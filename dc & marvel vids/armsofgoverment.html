      </ol>

      <dl>
        <dt>The legislative</dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>The legislature</strong> is the law making body of the
          government. It is also responsible for voting of money, approving of
          budget and carrying out over sight function. The legislators are the
          representative of the people and are generally regarded as the policy
          maker. The legislature also amends the constitution, controls the
          executive officials, carryout impeachment and disciplinary actions on
          public servants.

          legislature is one with only one chamber of the legislature while a
          bicameral legislature is one with two chambers of the legislature.

      <dl>
        <dt>The Executive</dt>
        <dd>
          The executive is the organ of government responsible for the
          implementation, execution or enforcement of laws and policies made by
          the legislative arm of the government
        </dd>
        <dd>
          <strong>The executive</strong> is led by the head of Government. The
          Head of Government is assisted by a number of ministers, who usually
          have responsibilities for particular areas (e.g. health, education,
          foreign affairs), and by a large number of government employees or
          civil servants.

      <dl>
        <dt>The Judiciary</dt>
        <dd>
          Judiciary is the third arm of government, whose primary role is to
          interpret laws enacted by the Legislature and applies such existing
          law to individual cases, in other to settle disputes between two
          private citizens or between private citizen(s) and the government.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          <strong>The judiciary</strong> can also be thought of as the mechanism
          for the resolution of disputes. Under the doctrine of the separation
          of powers, the judiciary generally does not make statutory law (which
          is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the
          responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets, defends, and
          applies the law to the facts of each case.
